## 📌 About the Project  
**YouTube Sync** is a simple and minimal web experience where users can share their favorite YouTube video — and the next visitor gets to watch it.

Paste your video link, send it off, and let a stranger discover it. In return, you'll get to see what someone else left for you. Anonymous, random, fun.
